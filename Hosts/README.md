# L4's Anti-Corp Hosts

I am boycott, and so can you!

Basically, I want to block certain corporations from my life, especially the ones that feel the need to buy out more and more companies, even if that company will be tainted by Big Corp's grubby hands. Advertising companies too, I refuse to deal with super invasive advertisements and I know I'm not the only one.

This will always be a work in progress and I'll probably make mistakes, or the corps listed here may buy out more companies that need to be added. Let me know about any missing sites or errors that I've made! I don't personally use every single one of these so I'm guaranteed to be missing stuff on at least one of them. **Suggestions for other corps are always welcome!** I may be slow to update ones that I don't use though.
