#00000 This goes out to my friends who do the pretendy fun-times online, even the ones who do weird tree stuff.
#00000 Please note that this file is US-centric and only tested on a Linux computer. Certain operating systems may require an entry like "::1 localhost.localdomain localhost my-ipv6-addr" be separated into "::1 localhost", "::1 my-ipv6-addr", etc.
#00000 Any entries with a "#not-all-verified" comment may not work for certain listed domains because I haven't personally tested them. Let me know if any don't work and I'll fix them as soon as I can. Any at the end with a "#z" comment are ones that I haven't done yet but I'm aware of them.
